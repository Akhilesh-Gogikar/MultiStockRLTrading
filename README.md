# Dependencies

1) Install Conda
2) If you have a GPU install - Cuda and Cudnn to enable GPU usage 

# Installation
To install the dependencies in a conda environment by running -> conda env create -f environment.yml

# Run
To run the experiments just run -> python train.py

# TensorBoard logs
You can check out the tensorboard logs by running the following command in a different terminal:
tensorboard --logdir tb_logs

You will find that not much info is being logged at this moment
